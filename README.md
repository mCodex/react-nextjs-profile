[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/mCodex/react-nextjs-profile.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/mCodex/react-nextjs-profile)

A template for user profiles, useful for a personal landing page. Built on React and NextJS.

You can simply fork this repo and edit the `data.js` file with your own info, then build and deploy the project to your favorite provider (See the live demo on Heroku [here](http://mcodex.herokuapp.com/)).

## Features
- Out-of-the-box integration with Google Analytics, you just have to set the `gaTrackingId` property in `data.js`
- Ready for continuous integration with Travis CI, just enable your forked repo in your Travis account
- I18n via [react-i18next](https://github.com/i18next/react-i18next)

## Contributing
We encourage you to contribute by forking the repository, making your changes, committing and creating a pull request. You can also create issues with questions or bug reports.

We care about code style, so there is a pre-commit hook that runs `eslint`. We also have test suites you can run with `yarn test`.
